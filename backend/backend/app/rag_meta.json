RRL trades in various consumption \nbaskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of \nconsideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised \non transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. \nTransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or \ncash equivalent from customers. In view of the above \nand since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, \nrevenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \nRRVL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by \nthem to address the key audit matter.

Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over \nfinancial reporting\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \nas a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial \naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant \non IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \nconsumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and \nthe increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s \nsystems and data, cyber security has become more significant. \nAutomated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, \nwhich include IT governance, IT general controls over program \ndevelopment and changes, access to program and data andOur procedures included and were not limited ",

The useful life and residual values are \nbased on the Group’s historical experience with \nsimilar assets and take into account anticipated \ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation / \namortisation for future periods is revised if there \nare significant changes from previous estimates.\n (C) Provisions\n   The timing of recognition and quantification of \nthe liability (including litigations) requires the \napplication of judgement to existing facts and \ncircumstances, which can be subject to change. \nThe carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities \nare reviewed regularly and revised to take account \nof changing facts and circumstances.\n (D)  Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible \nAssets under Development and Intangible  \nAssets with Indefinite Useful Life\n   Management reviews the carrying value of \ngood",
  "anging facts and circumstances.\n (D)  Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible \nAssets under Development and Intangible  \nAssets with Indefinite Useful Life\n   Management reviews the carrying value of \ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \nand intangible assets with indefinite useful \nlife annually, to determine whether there has \nbeen any impairment by allocating the value of \ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \nand intangible assets with indefinite useful life \nto a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has \nidentified CGUs’ for this purpose, considering \nthe nature of the businesses to which each of the \nCGU relates.\n   Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU \nis aggregate of cash flow projections, for five \nyears as approved by Senior Management and \nbeyond five years extrapolated using a long-term \ngrowth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash \nflow projections are discounted by a pre-tax \ndiscount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital (WACC), w",
  "e years extrapolated using a long-term \ngrowth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash \nflow projections are discounted by a pre-tax \ndiscount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.\n   The Management believes that any reasonably \npossible change in the above key assumptions on \nwhich recoverable amount is based would not \ncause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed \nthe aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.   Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite \nlives have been allocated to the respective CGUs. \nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the \nGroup has determined that there is no impairment \ntowards these assets.\n (E)  Impairment of Financial and \nNon -Financial Assets\n   The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \nare based on assumptions about risk of default \nand expected cash loss rates.

The Group uses \njudgement in making these assumptions and \nselecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, \nbased on Group’s past history, existing market \nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at \nthe end of each reporting period.\n   In case of non-financial assets, the Group \nestimates asset’s recoverable amount, which \nis higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Units \n(CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its \nvalue in use.\n   In assessing value in use, the estimated future \ncash flows are discounted to their present value \nusing pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money \nand the risks specific to the asset. In determining \nfair value less costs of disposal, recent market \ntransactions are taken into account, if no such \ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate \nvaluation model is used.  \n (F) Fair Value Measurement\n   For estimates relating to",

Identification of a lease requires significant \njudgement. The Group uses judgement in \nassessing whether a contract (or part of contract) \ninclude a lease, the lease term (including \nanticipated renewals), the applicable discount \nrate, variable lease payments whether are \nin-substance fixed.
